UniversalWire
=============

I continue the developement for MC 1.6.

Actual feature :
- Cable that can quarry EU and MJ at once (Ratio EU : 2 / Ratio MJ : 5). Note that more cable you add, more storage your system has. WARNING : Your system can't transmit more energy than it can stock.
- A tank block wich can be stack on any axys, to construct a tank of any shape !
